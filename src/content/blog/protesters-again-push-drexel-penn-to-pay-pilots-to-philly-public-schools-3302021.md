> Over 100 students, teachers, and community members marched through Drexel and the University of Pennsylvania’s campuses on Thursday evening calling on both schools to make payments in lieu of taxes to support the School District of Philadelphia. A drumline led the protesters through the streets, organized by advocates from Philadelphia Jobs With Justice, the Our City Our Schools Coalition, Penn for PILOTs, Home and Schools Association, Caucus of Working Educators, Juntos, and other groups.
