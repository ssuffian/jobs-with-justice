Working people in Philadelphia have fought HARD for our progressive labor laws, but laws aren't enough if the city doesn't have our back when it comes to enforcing them! [caption id="attachment_239" align="alignnone" width="700"]![](http://phillyjwj.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3BSW7TAD35CX7O2XVWGCE5A53E-1024x682.jpg) Photo via the Philadelphia Inquirer[/caption] On February 12th, we marched with the Coalition to Respect Every Worker (CREW) to demand: -Independent Office of Labor -Full Funding for Enforcement -Worker Oversight Board, Whistleblower Protections  -Wall-to-Wall Enforcement -Community Regrants for Worker Outreach! On February 13th, City Council UNANIMOUSLY passed a bill to establish an independent office of labor! [From the Inquirer](https://www.inquirer.com/jobs/labor/philadelphia-labor-law-enforcement-permanent-agency-20200213.html): 

> The bill — introduced by Councilmembers Helen Gym and Bobby Henon in partnership with the Kenney administration — would pose this question to voters in the April primary: Should the city create a permanent Department of Labor that would enforce city labor laws and function as a front door for all worker-related issues?
> 
> The question has to be put to voters because it requires a city charter change.
> 
> Right now, the Mayor’s Office of Labor, created under the Kenney administration, provides these services, but advocates fear a future mayor with different priorities could scrap the office all together.
> 
> This effort is part of a broader push by advocates and organizers for stronger labor law enforcement in a city that’s [passed some of the most progressive pro-worker legislation in the country](https://www.inquirer.com/news/fair-workweek-labor-laws-worker-organizing-20190731.html) but has [historically failed](https://www.inquirer.com/news/fair-workweek-enforcement-philadelphia-office-of-labor-standards-20190320.html) to both educate workers about these laws and [enforce them](https://www.inquirer.com/business/security-guards-prevailing-wage-32bj-seiu-penn-temple-water-discount-20191204.html).
> 
> That [started to change](https://www.inquirer.com/jobs/labor/philadelphia-labor-office-enforcement-violations-wage-theft-20200109.html) in the last year, as advocates who pushed for these laws [set their sights on enforcement](https://www.inquirer.com/news/labor-enforcement-office-philadelphia-funding-worker-protection-laws-20190430.html). Advocates won a modest increase in funding for the Mayor’s Office of Labor, which [grew its budget](https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-office-labor-enforcement-funding-20190613.html) to nearly $1.1 million this year and doubled its staff to six. The number of complaints filed by workers to the office quadrupled from 2018 to 2019 to nearly 100.
