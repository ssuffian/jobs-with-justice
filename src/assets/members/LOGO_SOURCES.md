## Download Tips

1. **Official Websites**: Most organizations have their logos in the website header/footer. Right-click and "Save Image As" or inspect the page source to find the logo URL.

2. **Media/Press Kits**: Many organizations have a "Media" or "Press" section with downloadable logos in various formats.

3. **Contact Organizations**: If logos aren't publicly available, contact the organization directly. They're usually happy to provide logos for coalition/partnership use.

4. **Wikipedia Commons**: Some union logos are available on Wikipedia Commons, but verify usage rights.

5. **File Formats**: Prefer PNG (with transparency) or SVG formats. Recommended size: 200-300px width, maintaining aspect ratio.

## Naming Convention

When saving logos, use this naming convention:
- Convert organization name to lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove special characters
- Use appropriate file extension (.png, .svg, etc.)

Example: `seiu-healthcare-pa.png`, `sag-aftra-philadelphia.svg`
